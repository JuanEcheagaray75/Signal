# TODO

- [ ] Determine if we should save the data as CSV files, check whether another file format is better.
  - [ ] Check if pandas should be used for this conversion
- [ ] Check how Librosa "normalizes" the wav file, maybe scipyÂ´s conversion is better
- [ ] Study the output of FFT, I have already developed a version that returns an output that matches that of scipy's fft
